  component, that
  (a) displays drives/directories in the DirectoryTree and files of the
      selected directory in a popup FileListView.  Thus, directories can be
      selected from the DirectoryTree, and files can be selected or opened
      in the FileListView;
  (b) suports creating, renaming, deleting, copying, moving and dragging-
      dropping operations on directories;
  (c) calculates the size of a selected portion of the directory-tree.
  (d) connects/disconnects network drives.

  TLsDirTreeCombo28 is a specialized ComboBox with a dropdown Directory
  TreeView, that displays a hierarchical tree of drives and directories of
  the File System.

  1.3 TLsFilelistView28 w/TLsFilelistViewPopUp28
  ----------------------------------------------
  TLsFilelistView28 is a File ListView component, which is operating in the
  "virtual mode" and is optimized for high capacity and fast speed access.  
  In addition to its normal functions, It can also:
  (a) performs various file management tasks, such as cut, copy, paste, 
      rename, delete, open, view, send_to or drag-drop operations on files;
  (b) copy files to, or paste files from, Windows Explorer or other Windows
      applications;
  (c) accept dropping files from Windows Explorer;
  (d) provides statistics on Disk-FreeSpace, Selected-Numbers and -Size.

  Both TlsFilelistView28 and LsDirTree21 provide Chinese, Dutch, French,
  German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Slovenian,

4. Installation
===============

 4.1 Unzip FileExpl.zip to any directory, then copy the following files into a
     directory you choose. 

       LsComp.inc
       LsConsts.pas
       LsTheme.pas
       LsFileExplorer28.dcr
       LsFileExplorer28.pas
       LsFileExplorer28.res

     Select "Tools\Environment Option ..." menu item in Delphi IDE, then goto
     "Library" tab to add the full path of the above directory into Delphi's 
     Library search path.


 4.2 Install into LsComp package:

   - Use "File\Open ..." menu item in Delphi IDE to open "LsComp.dpk".

   - When "Package ..." dialog appears, click "Compile" then "Install"
     buttons to install and register VCLs in the package.

   - Right click the "Package..." dialog to save the package source.   

 4.3 Alternately, all three components can be added into an existing Package,
     eg. Samples or Delphi User's Components Package, by following steps:

   - Choose Component|Install Component; ensure that 'Into existing package'
     tab is selected and the 'Package file name' is correct.

   - From Install Component Dialog, click Browse.

   - In the Unit FileName Dialog, navigate to your chosen directory and
     select LsFileExplorer28.pas, LsFileExplorer28.dcr, LsComp.inc, 
     LsConsts.pas and LsTheme.pas, then click Open.

   - In the Install Component Dialog, click OK to compile and install the
     package.

   - Finally, right-click the "Package ..." diallog to save the package.


5. Notes on Usage
=================

5.1 Interconnecting components
------------------------------

If you use both TLsDirTree21 (or TLsDirTreeCombo28) and TLsFilelistView28
components in an application, they must be mutually connected through the use
of the TLsDirTree21's (or TLsDirTreeCombo28's) 'FileList' property and the
TLsFileListView28's 'DirTree' property (or 'DirTreeCombo' property if
TLsDirTreeCombo28 is used). Once they are interconnected, changes in one
component will be automatically reflected in the other component.

For example, the LsDirTree21 and LsFilelistView28 components in your application
are named as LsDirTree211 and LsFilelistView281 respectively. You can use Object
Inspector to set LsDirTree211's 'FileList' property to LsFilelistView281;
likewise, set LsFilelistView281's 'DirTree' property to LsDirTree211.

5.4 If MultiSelect Property of TLsFilelistView28 is set to True, GetNextItem
    function or a for-loop can be used to find all selected items.
