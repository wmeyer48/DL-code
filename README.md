Demo code for the Delphi Legacy Projects book

Most of the projects are sufficiently covered in the book.

The ProjectFiles application has some caveats:
1. It is not fully developed or polished.
2. It requires a recent version of Delphi.
3. If uses the Raize components.
4. It uses LsFileExplorer, which is also in the github folder.
